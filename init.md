# EB Init Steps

- npx create-turbo@latest turby
- use `npm workspaces`

```sh
>>> Success! Created a new Turborepo at "turby".
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run build
     Build all apps and packages

  npm run dev
     Develop all apps and packages

  npm run lint
     Lint all apps and packages

Turborepo will cache locally by default. For an additional
speed boost, enable Remote Caching with Vercel by
entering the following command:

  npx turbo login

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd turby
  npx turbo login
```

## Turbo Login

```sh
 npx turbo login
>>> Opening browser to https://vercel.com/turborepo/token?redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9789

>>> Success! Turborepo CLI authorized for ma****@gmail.com
To connect to your Remote Cache, run the following in any turborepo:
  npx turbo link

```
